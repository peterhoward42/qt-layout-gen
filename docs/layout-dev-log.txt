o  Portability
    o  Constraints
        o  Py Side does not support beyond Qt4
        o  Py Side does not support latest Python3, which is Python3.6

    o  Explore use in Python2.7 and Python3.6
        o  Works with Py Side in Python 2.7 - brings in Qt4.6
        o  Try in Python3.6 with Py Qt5 - brings in Qt5.8
            *  Do branch to experiment with
            o  Focus on lib tests
                *  Needs Py Side.QtGui replacing with PyQt5.QtWidgets
                *  Print needs to be fn
                *  Delibarate unicode errors must be rawed
                *  Some file io (write) needs bytes-like object not string

                o  Some wierd abnormal exit codes
                    o  builder and widgetandlayoutfinder

            o  Now api tests
            o  And helper

        o  Recipe for coping with both with duplicate imports or similar?

    o  Regression in Python2.7 for all remedies


o  ditch _ classes convention
o  Rationalise tests and example files
o  Licence and copyright
o  Version contract product versions like pycharm eg 2017.1
o  Portability incl PyQt support
o  Viable to put on PyPi?
