o  Make examples as proper tests incl name and folder
o  Examples tests modules from txt
    *  v simple from txt
    o  big realistic to shake out and mabye use as exemplars
        *  capture desired scope
        *  make mockup
        o  just develop by experimentation and addition

                            o  strip down existing code into tiny bits
                            o  introduce line consumer that Is-A FSM?
            o  consider simple try catch sequence of add operations
            o  addTab
            o  parse quoted strings

    o  merit of splitting into separate files?

    o  lessons learned and fixes
        o  Allow quoted strings in record?
        o  AddTab
    o  did i need to instantiate non qt classes or should I like clickablewidget?



    o  v simple from dir



                o  using q widgets that have children

                o  check doc what missed
        o  more use of assert?
        o  tests that test errors by catching exceptions should throw exception if not thrown
        o  80 columns and '\n'.join... idiom
        o  example formats to error messages
        o  ditch _ classes convention
        o  cope with group boxes
            o  first class
            o  examples

        o  api
        o  all tests pass
        o  beautify
        o  no warnings
        o  real world try

                try:
            app = QApplication([])
            kk
        except RuntimeError:
            pass # Singleton already existso  docco
