o  Portability
    o  Constraints
        o  Py Side supports only Qt4 (not Qt5)
        o  Py Side Python 3 support is behind Python releases (no 3.6)
        o  PyQt5 (Python 3) crashes on Windows 10

    o  Results
        o  PySide Python2.7 Qt4 Windows = yes
        o  PySide Python2.7 Qt4 Linux   = ?
        o  PySide Python3               = no (support lags at 3.4)

    o  Try Pyside 2.7 on linux
        o  Checkout main (not branch)
        o  Regression test fix up on windows
        o  Make sure got python 2.7
        o  Install pyside
        o  Clear pycs
        o  Try tests

    o  Take stock - leave it as pyside?

    o  Portability notes?

    o  Try PyQt python 3 on Linux (we know struggles on Windows)
        o  Install pyqt5 on linux vm
        o  Attempt tests with branch



        o  Works with Py Side in Python 2.7 - brings in Qt4.6
        o  Try in Python3.6 with Py Qt5 - brings in Qt5.8
            *  Do branch to experiment with
            o  Focus on lib tests
                *  Needs Py Side.QtGui replacing with PyQt5.QtWidgets
                *  Print needs to be fn
                *  Delibarate unicode errors must be rawed
                *  Some file io (write) needs bytes-like object not string

                o  Access violation if instantiate QLabel
                    o  Is qt installed in its own right?
                    o  Reinstall pyqt5

            o  Now api tests
            o  And helper

        o  Recipe for coping with both with duplicate imports or similar?

    o  Regression in Python2.7 for all remedies
    o  Now check Linux


o  ditch _ classes convention
o  Rationalise tests and example files
o  Licence and copyright
o  Version contract product versions like pycharm eg 2017.1
o  Portability incl PyQt support
o  Viable to put on PyPi?
