o  Reboot with new contract
    *  Write contract
    *  Tag code base
    *  Meta design of indentation consumption
    *  Meta design of context in error handling
    o  Code most of it top down
        o  Unit test utilities
            *  regex
            *  builder helpers
        o  Higher level tests
            o  Work through builder behaviour, getting bits to work
               and diverting into unit test bring up of dependencies.
               o  Convert to only use single string
                    *  util to clean multiline string
                        *  need to remove solely-whitespace last line also.
                    o  better way for error formation and comparison
                        o  use test assert multiple of two as driver
                            *  write raises_layout_error_with_this_message
                                *  write and test mline string normalise
                                o  test raises layout blah
                                    o  stuck on string comparison
                                        o  make normalise rm newlines?
                        o  use new test regime in tests for builder, regex and string utils
                        o  now normalise generation of errors
                    o  file utils
               o  Separate into a class the interp state
               o  Make builder more modular and file smaller
               o  Don't try to find parent for top level widgets or try
                  to add them thereto.

o  Later
    o  Unify use of multiline tests and generation.
    o  Move all regex into module


o  Make examples as proper tests incl name and folder
o  Examples tests modules from txt
    *  v simple from txt
    o  big realistic to shake out and mabye use as exemplars
        *  capture desired scope
        *  make mockup
        o  just develop by experimentation and addition
            *  need to support setlayout for QFrame
            *  try using groupbox instead of frame cos can see it
            *  timeout - redefine contract as having name first!!!
            *  allow comments somehow for big example?
            *  double underscore space subst
            *  consider simple try catch sequence of add operations
            o  allow space after first word
                *  first see if indentation and comments look ok
                *  would spaces help?
                    *  play around
                o  lessons learned?
                    o  Tabular is nice, maybe first two words
                    o  More keywords
                    o  Case insen keywords
                    o  USE LINES
                    o  USE ORDER
                    o  HAVE FORMATTER in situ
                    o  HAVE SEARCH ACCESS TO TREE
                    o  HAVE DEV MODE WHERE GIVES DIAGNOSTICS and more help
                o  Merits a branch because of order dependent processing !!!
            o  get diagnostic ready
            o  position diagnostics as formatter
            o  would diagnostic view server better?
                o  there's a thought?

    o  add text to filelocaton?
    o  merit of splitting into separate files?

    o  lessons learned and fixes
    o  did i need to instantiate non qt classes or should I like clickablewidget?
    o  v simple from dir



                o  using q widgets that have children
                o  using your own widgets
                o  using the query api
                o  using the debugging tools
                o  a nice big complex one
                o  check doc what missed
        o  more use of assert?
        o  tests that test errors by catching exceptions should throw exception if not thrown
        o  80 columns and '\n'.join... idiom
        o  example formats to error messages
        o  ditch _ classes convention
        o  cope with group boxes
            o  first class
            o  examples
            o  add text to
        o  add strings to labels, buttons and group boxes
        o  api
        o  all tests pass
        o  beautify
        o  no warnings
        o  real world try

                try:
            app = QApplication([])
            kk
        except RuntimeError:
            pass # Singleton already existso  docco

Meta design of indentation consumption
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

state
    previous line's indent
    current parent object per indentation level
    path stack

consume line
  remove comments
  if nothing remains noop otherwise the following must work
  if whole line is comment ignore
  measure indnet and assert multiple of 2 or zero
  remove trailing comments
  isolate and remove parenthesised args
  isolate exactly two words - name and type

  if indented by 2 wrt previous line's indent:
    pop = 0
    add child to parent defined by indent - 2

  if indented same as previous line's indent:
    pop = 1
    add child to parent defined by or indent - 2

  if indented by less than previous line's indent:
    pop = calc
    potential negative index error
    parent to add to is 2 less than this indent

  in all cases
    pop pop number from path stack
    push new name onto path stack
    save current item at level

  afterwards apply text

  store item on ordered dict created at its path name

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    o  Meta design of context in error handling
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Line looper can catch lower exceptions and write contextual report. E.g.
pre and post lines. With content.

So lower exceptions should report only line objections.
