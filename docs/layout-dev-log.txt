o  Reboot with new contract
    o  Write contract
    o  Tag code base
    o  Code most of it top down then test



o  Make examples as proper tests incl name and folder
o  Examples tests modules from txt
    *  v simple from txt
    o  big realistic to shake out and mabye use as exemplars
        *  capture desired scope
        *  make mockup
        o  just develop by experimentation and addition
            *  need to support setlayout for QFrame
            *  try using groupbox instead of frame cos can see it
            *  timeout - redefine contract as having name first!!!
            *  allow comments somehow for big example?
            *  double underscore space subst
            *  consider simple try catch sequence of add operations
            o  allow space after first word
                *  first see if indentation and comments look ok
                *  would spaces help?
                    *  play around
                o  lessons learned?
                    o  Tabular is nice, maybe first two words
                    o  More keywords
                    o  Case insen keywords
                    o  USE LINES
                    o  USE ORDER
                    o  HAVE FORMATTER in situ
                    o  HAVE SEARCH ACCESS TO TREE
                    o  HAVE DEV MODE WHERE GIVES DIAGNOSTICS and more help
                o  Merits a branch because of order dependent processing !!!
            o  get diagnostic ready
            o  position diagnostics as formatter
            o  would diagnostic view server better?
                o  there's a thought?

    o  add text to filelocaton?
    o  merit of splitting into separate files?

    o  lessons learned and fixes
    o  did i need to instantiate non qt classes or should I like clickablewidget?
    o  v simple from dir



                o  using q widgets that have children
                o  using your own widgets
                o  using the query api
                o  using the debugging tools
                o  a nice big complex one
                o  check doc what missed
        o  more use of assert?
        o  tests that test errors by catching exceptions should throw exception if not thrown
        o  80 columns and '\n'.join... idiom
        o  example formats to error messages
        o  ditch _ classes convention
        o  cope with group boxes
            o  first class
            o  examples
            o  add text to
        o  add strings to labels, buttons and group boxes
        o  api
        o  all tests pass
        o  beautify
        o  no warnings
        o  real world try

                try:
            app = QApplication([])
            kk
        except RuntimeError:
            pass # Singleton already existso  docco
