o  Make examples as proper tests incl name and folder
o  Examples tests modules from txt
    *  v simple from txt
    o  big realistic to shake out and mabye use as exemplars
        *  capture desired scope
        *  make mockup
        o  just start with a test
            *  timeout two children of same name when <>
            o  change set text to use sole child
                *  consider how expressed in contract
                    *  says don't have to specify children
                    *  says child comprise things that can be resolved on lhs
                    *  says have to make sure supports addwid or addlay
                    *  'this is  how you add things like labels'
                *  update contract
                *  tdd to make it so
                    *  refactor existing so that pass only child name to
                       child adder, moving attempt to resolve it down a level
                    *  regression up
                        *  child adder tests
                        *  builder tests
                        *  all tests
                    *  make a test that expects setText on a button using
                       new contract
                       *  builder test api does but looks wrong
                    *  satisfy all tests and regression
                o  digress arbit record and file loc into test utils
                o  digress better test than lots of in
                o  upgrade realist text to exploit set text on label
            o  addTab
            o  parse quoted strings


    o  lessons learned and fixes
        o  QLabel setText needs to be independtend of what you call it
        o  Allow quoted strings in record?
        o  AddTab
    o  did i need to instantiate non qt classes or should I like clickablewidget?



    o  v simple from dir



                o  using q widgets that have children
                o  using your own widgets
                o  using the query api
                o  using the debugging tools
                o  a nice big complex one
                o  check doc what missed
        o  more use of assert?
        o  tests that test errors by catching exceptions should throw exception if not thrown
        o  80 columns and '\n'.join... idiom
        o  example formats to error messages
        o  ditch _ classes convention
        o  cope with group boxes
            o  first class
            o  examples
            o  add text to
        o  add strings to labels, buttons and group boxes
        o  api
        o  all tests pass
        o  beautify
        o  no warnings
        o  real world try

                try:
            app = QApplication([])
            kk
        except RuntimeError:
