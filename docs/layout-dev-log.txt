    o  has to be top down :-( too difficult otherwise
        o  reconcile child
        o  check comments in all modules

        o  start on entry point to provide directon
        o  resolve a qtlabel type
        o  resolve reserved word shorthand
        o  resolve pre instantiated by discovery

    o  entry point from dir
    o  entry point from text
    o  queries and nav

o  Remember to demand that children are not reused
