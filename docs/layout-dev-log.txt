o  Restart with new design
    o  TDD on simple api case to drive out core code flows
        *  Reconsider syntax to make it easier to just grab and go with less fussy parsing.
           And accomodate find idiom.
        *  Write up lexical parsing
        *  Fix up and simplify lexical parsing with less error detection.
        o  Ditch error handling strategy
            o  Design exception based one
                *  Requirements
                *  Remove BuildError
                *  Create LayoutException
                o  Begin to feed in bottom up
                    *  directory search
                    *  input splitter
                    o  parent maker
                        *  recognizer
                        o  qword type
                    o  api
                    o  layout maker (ditch class method too nasty) - do real work in constructor!!!
                o  Go back to test utils
        o  module exports should not be _
        o  Code and test parent maker
            o  Q object type
            o  discovery type
            o  keyword type
        o  Resume main flow
        o

    o  Housekeep redundant modules and tests


o  Remember to demand that children are not reused

Exception handling
--------------------------------------------------------
Requirements
    o  It is a lib so must leave freedom of presentation to client.
    o  Nice if lib consumer only has to catch one type.
    o  Nice if exception gives narrative from developers pov about
       what went wrong.
    o  Which is input file oriented - they don't care about internal concepts.
    o  So what concepts should we expose?

    o  A couple of example error messages,

        Error: Cannot read this file filename

        Error: The first thing in a file must be a word with a colon in it: (filename/no)

        Error: Failed trying to import one of these <> from QtGui?. (filename/no)

    o  Architecture - just one Exception type with str message fully formed at bottom level whereever poss
       then need not catch!
