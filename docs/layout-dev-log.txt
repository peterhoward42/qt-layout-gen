*  Manual note about rules and error handling
o  Go back to gui runner
    o  Revert to timer
        *  Comment
        *  Bring in handler and thread from watch
        *  Recompose gui
        *  Put content of handle build in event handler
        *  Hide old one for now
        o  Make sure assess of mtime is robust
            o  Make time v fast to stimulate probs
                o  Put calls to mtime in loop that tries mtime until succeeds.
                o  But protect with timeout
                o  Use timeout to explain problem
                o  May be able to test with duff initial value for input file

            o  Push time back to sensible
        o  Showing when changed and not otherwise?
        o  How deal with no file specified or file missing vs being locked
        o  What locks and waits must we have
        o  Finish up
            o  Don't hide old one should GC




    o  make as gui prog with show or reformat buttons, no polling
        o  mature uxp
            *  naming and titling and main window style
            o  don't use stack use vbox with text area atop and
            o  user content below
            o  when writing text just write to log area
            o  when showing, write done to log area
            o  content win should shrink to contents
                o  is this stack?
            o  layout tune
            o  sizing
            o  styling

            o  make enter be default button
        o  full testing
            o  short input file path with -30
        o  auto testing for regression
    o  doc

o  Decide what to do about fonts and colours
o  Finish demo example
o

    o  test when works
        o  overwrite tricky
            *  is overwrite demanding to succeed? = yes
            o  neither vi nor pycharm alert you to reload file immediately
        o  position of window and on top
    o  test when fails
*  Revisit mockup to showcase what is supported
o  font etc inline?

o  k

o  Start working up
    o  Do footer
    o  It has to look perfect to wash


o  Bugs
    o  Try this input.
        o  bar       QPushButton(Worl)d
        o  thinks qpushbuttond is a type


o  Laters
o  Quality
    o  Any modules getting too big or too small?
    o  Comments
    o  PEP8
    o  Manual edit / review
        o  Split into sections
        o  Include pictures
        o  Have TOC with links


o  Later
    o  Version contract
    o  Product versions like pycharm eg 2017.1
    o  Spread use of fuzzy equality of multiline strings
    o  Make sure all examples from the manual are tested
    o  Qt versions
    o  Licence and copyright
    o  Python 3 support
    o  Qt5 support
    o  Test on Linux
    o  PyQt support
    o  Unify use of multiline tests and generation.
    o  Move all regex into module
    o  Viable to put on PyPy
    o  What other types to support?
        o  lineedit, combo, splitter, radio, groupbox


o  Make examples as proper tests incl name and folder

        o  tests that test errors by catching exceptions should throw exception if not thrown
        o  80 columns and '\n'.join... idiom
        o  ditch _ classes convention
        o  beautify
        o  no warnings

------------------------------------------------------------------------
A monitor design
------------------------------------------------------------------------
o  Same entry point would be nice with flag to say keep listening
o  Could block in a loop waiting for mtime on file to change
    o  In passive loop output listening...
o  When stimulated could
    o  Hide incumbent widget
    o  Garbage collect incumbent widget
    o  Run builder and show widget catching exceptions
    o  Exception prevents attempt to show duff layout
    o  In catch print to std out what exception was
