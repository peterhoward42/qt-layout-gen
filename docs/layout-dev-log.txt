o  Portability
    o  Constraints
        o  PySide does not support beyond Qt4
        o  PySide does not support latest Python3, which is Python3.6

    o  Explore use in Python2.7 and Python3.6
        o  Works with PySide in Python 2.7 - brings in Qt4.6
        o  Try in Python3.6 with PyQt5 - brings in Qt5.8
            o  Needs PySide.QtGui replacing with PyQt5.QtWidgets
                o  Do branch to experiment with

    o  Explore PySide scope available
        o  Windows
            o  Python27 + PySide = success (brings in Qt4.6)
            o  Cannot use with Python36, because PySide support stops at Python34
            o  Seems python27 + qt4.6 is the default setup.
    o  Explore PyQt scope available
        o  Windows
            o  PyQt strongly advocating Python 3 and Qt5 so try those

o  ditch _ classes convention
o  Rationalise tests and example files
o  Licence and copyright
o  Version contract product versions like pycharm eg 2017.1
o  Portability incl PyQt support
o  Viable to put on PyPi?
