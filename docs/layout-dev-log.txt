o  Make examples as proper tests incl name and folder
o  Examples tests modules from txt
    *  v simple from txt
    o  big realistic to shake out and mabye use as exemplars
        *  capture desired scope
        *  make mockup
        o  just develop by experimentation and addition
            *  need to support setlayout for QFrame
            *  try using groupbox instead of frame cos can see it
            *  timeout - redefine contract as having name first!!!

            *  double underscore space subst
            *  consider simple try catch sequence of add operations
            o  allow space after first word
            o  get diagnostic ready

    o  did i need to instantiate non qt classes or should I like clickablewidget?
    o  v simple from dir



                o  using q widgets that have children
                o  using your own widgets
                o  using the query api
                o  using the debugging tools
                o  a nice big complex one
                o  check doc what missed
        o  more use of assert?
        o  tests that test errors by catching exceptions should throw exception if not thrown
        o  80 columns and '\n'.join... idiom
        o  example formats to error messages
        o  ditch _ classes convention
        o  cope with group boxes
            o  first class
            o  examples
            o  add text to
        o  add strings to labels, buttons and group boxes
        o  api
        o  all tests pass
        o  beautify
        o  no warnings
        o  real world try

                try:
            app = QApplication([])
            kk
        except RuntimeError:
            pass # Singleton already existso  docco
