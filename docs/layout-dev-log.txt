o  Restart with new design
    o  TDD on simple api case to drive out core code flows
        *  Reconsider syntax to make it easier to just grab and go with less fussy parsing.
           And accomodate find idiom.
        *  Write up lexical parsing
        *  Fix up and simplify lexical parsing with less error detection.
        *  Ditch error handling strategy
        *  Separate InputTextRecord
        *  Separate filelocation
        *  Repair input splitter
        *  Finish parent maker
        *  Builder
        *  If parent has no children, try set text with name on
            *  consider where = in build itself
            *  augment build and tdd augmented bit
            *  add to contract
        *  Timeout for all tests pass
        o  Make examples as proper tests incl name and folder
            o  Examples tests modules from txt
                o  v simple from txt
                    o  digress to support <>, incl tests
                        o  input text record including more than one <> present
                        o  child adder
                            o  works
                            o  op failed on parent
                        o  builder
                        o  include in api example
                o  v simple from dir
                o  simple incl find
                o  example diagnostics
                o  big one
        o  more use of assert?
        o  tests that test errors by catching exceptions should throw exception if not thrown
        o  80 columns and '\n'.join... idiom
        o  example formats to error messages
        o  ditch _ classes convention
        o  cope with group boxes
            o  first class
            o  examples
            o  add text to
        o  add strings to labels, buttons and group boxes
        o  api
        o  all tests pass
        o  beautify
        o  no warnings
        o  real world try

                try:
            app = QApplication([])
            kk
        except RuntimeError:
            pass # Singleton already existso  docco
