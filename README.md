### Quick Summary

A python library that works with PyQt or PySide to make it **very**
much quicker and easier to develop GUIs. And make it very much easier
to change and iterate layouts.

##### Key Goals:
- Fast workflow for the developer
- Instant feedback
- Make layouts easier to change
- Operate at runtime; no compile+integrate steps
- Direct, programmatic access to all objects created
- Practical to introduce to existing code, step by step
- No interference with standard Qt workings
